# Campus Event Management System 

## Introduction
This Campus Event Management System is designed to streamline the organization and management of events within a campus environment. With role-based access, the system efficiently handles attendee registration, event scheduling, and reporting.

## Core Objectives
* Design and implement a Campus Event Management System. 
* Enable role-based access for event management. 
* Facilitate registration and tracking of attendees (students, staff, visitors). 
* Manage event scheduling and capacity. 
* Integrate advanced Python programming skills, including file handling, and real-world application design. 

## Features and Core Functionalities

### 1. Roles and Access Control
The system defines three primary roles, each with distinct privileges:

* **Admin**:
    * Create, update, and delete events. 
    * View all events and attendees. 

* **Event Organizer**:
    * Manage attendee registration for their events. 
    * View event details. 

* **Student/Visitor**:
    * Search for events and register. 
    * View their registered events. 

### 2. Event Management
* Add, update, and delete events. 
* Track event capacity (e.g., maximum attendees). 
* Input validation for event names, dates, and capacities. 

### 3. Attendee Registration
* Register attendees for events with capacity checks. 
* Provide a confirmation message for successful registration. 
* Prevent duplicate registrations. 

### 4. Calculations and Reporting
* Calculate the total number of attendees across all events. 
* Identify events with the highest and lowest attendance. 

### 5. Data Persistence
* Save events and attendee data to files (CSV or JSON). 
* Export statistical reports to files (e.g., CSV) for easy sharing. 

## Submission Requirements

### Code
* A complete Python implementation of the Event Management System. 

### Documentation
* Provide a flowchart to show the user interactions with the system. 
* Well-explained description of methods in the program. 

### Screenshots
* Demonstrating interactions for each user role. 

## Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation will be based on the following factors:

* **Functionality and Coverage** (40%): Includes event management, registration, and reporting. 
* **Code Quality** (20%): Readable and modular code. 
* **Documentation** (20%): Well-explained clear flowchart and description of methods in the program. 
* **Creativity and Features** (20%): Additional features like automated notifications or search filters.
