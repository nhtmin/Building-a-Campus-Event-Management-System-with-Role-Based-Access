# Campus Event Management System 

## Introduction
This Campus Event Management System is designed to streamline the organization and management of events within a campus environment. With role-based access, the system efficiently handles attendee registration and tracking for students, staff, and visitors. This project is a real-world application that integrates advanced Python programming skills, including file handling.

## Core Objectives
* [cite_start]Design and implement a Campus Event Management System. 
* [cite_start]Enable role-based access for event management. 
* [cite_start]Facilitate registration and tracking of attendees (students, staff, visitors). 
* [cite_start]Manage event scheduling and capacity. 
* [cite_start]Integrate advanced Python programming skills, including file handling, and real-world application design. 

## Features and Core Functionalities

### 1. Roles and Access Control
The system defines three primary roles, each with distinct privileges:

* **Admin**:
    * [cite_start]Create, update, and delete events. 
    * [cite_start]View all events and attendees. 

* **Event Organizer**:
    * [cite_start]Manage attendee registration for their events. 
    * [cite_start]View event details. 

* **Student/Visitor**:
    * [cite_start]Search for events and register. 
    * [cite_start]View their registered events. 

### 2. Event Management
* [cite_start]Add, update, and delete events. 
* [cite_start]Track event capacity (e.g., maximum attendees). 
* [cite_start]Input validation for event names, dates, and capacities. 

### 3. Attendee Registration
* [cite_start]Register attendees for events with capacity checks. 
* [cite_start]Provide a confirmation message for successful registration. 
* [cite_start]Prevent duplicate registrations. 

### 4. Calculations and Reporting
* [cite_start]Calculate the total number of attendees across all events. 
* [cite_start]Identify events with the highest and lowest attendance. 

### 5. Data Persistence
* [cite_start]Save events and attendee data to files (CSV or JSON). 
* [cite_start]Export statistical reports to files (e.g., CSV) for easy sharing. 

## Submission Requirements

### Code
* [cite_start]A complete Python implementation of the Event Management System. 

### Documentation
* [cite_start]Provide a flowchart to show the user interactions with the system. 
* [cite_start]Well-explained description of methods in the program. 

### Screenshots
* [cite_start]Demonstrating interactions for each user role. 

## Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation will be based on the following factors:

* [cite_start]**Functionality and Coverage** (40%): Includes event management, registration, and reporting. 
* [cite_start]**Code Quality** (20%): Readable and modular code. 
* [cite_start]**Documentation** (20%): Well-explained clear flowchart and description of methods in the program. 
* [cite_start]**Creativity and Features** (20%): Additional features like automated notifications or search filters.
